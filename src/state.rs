//! Application state: the seeded credential store and, once created, each tenant's `accreta`
//! engine.
//!
//! v1 is 1:1:1 (one tenant, one user, one schema), so `DashMap<Username, TenantRecord>` doubles
//! as the tenant registry — there is no separate schema registry.
//!
//! ## Why this also carries a shadow dimension dictionary
//!
//! Reading `accreta` 0.1.1's source turned up two gaps versus what the design summary assumed:
//!
//! - `accreta::Schema` exposes `dimension_count()` but never the dimension **names** — only
//!   `Schema::measures()` is introspectable that way. So this service has to track dimension
//!   names itself (`SchemaMeta::dimensions` below), in the same order they were declared —
//!   which is also `DimensionId` order, since `SchemaBuilder::dimension` assigns IDs
//!   sequentially.
//! - `accreta::Engine` interns dimension *values* (e.g. `"us-east"`) into per-dimension
//!   dictionaries at ingest time, but never exposes a way to read them back — no
//!   `resolve(id) -> &str` and no filter-by-value query. `Engine::query_range_grouped` only
//!   groups by a `DimensionMask`; it has no equality-filter parameter at all.
//!
//! Both gaps are closed the same way: this service keeps its own [`DimDict`] per dimension,
//! updated in lockstep with every `Engine::ingest` call (same strings, same per-sample order),
//! which gives it both directions (`resolve` for building query responses, and `value -> id` for
//! implementing the `filter` clause by hand over `Engine::buckets`/`Bucket::groups` — see
//! `query_api.rs`).
